/**
 * var does not care about scope, while let works within its defined scope.
 * so var can cause unwanted changes at evey place it is used with same name;
 * 
 * let only works within the scope and does not affect 
 * the same named variabale which are beyond the scope.
 * 
 * it is advised to always use let and const, never use var.
 * 
 * variables only decalred but not initialised are undefined in js.
